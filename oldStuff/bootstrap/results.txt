Notes: 
Bootstrap is a studentized bootstrap, nboot = 10000. Resamples that have exactly 1 unique element are ignored. 
CLT uses T-score confidence interval from Stat I. 

The coverage rate for log normal distribution is generally less than alpha, but for large N (N = 100) it is <5% off. The bootstrap is always worse than the CLT. 

Based off eyeballing a couple of failed runs, the bootstrap tends to underestimate the mean drastically. Possibly an error in linear interpolation?

The coverage rate for a normal distribution is generally alpha, for both the bootstrap and CLT. 

Since this program does not attempt to resample if a sample is "bad" (var = 0), low sample sizes tend to suffer in accuracy.
